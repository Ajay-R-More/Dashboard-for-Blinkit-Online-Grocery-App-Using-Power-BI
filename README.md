**Problem Statement 1: Sales performance varies significantly across different outlet types, with some types underperforming.**
Conclusion:
The analysis reveals significant sales discrepancies across different outlet types. Specifically, supermarket-type outlets outperform grocery stores in overall sales. However, certain product categories within grocery stores show potential for growth, indicating an opportunity to refine the product mix and marketing strategies tailored to these outlet types. By addressing these gaps, particularly in underperforming outlet types, there is potential to boost overall sales performance and ensure a more balanced contribution across different outlet types.

**Problem Statement 2: Items with low visibility in the store have significantly lower sales compared to high-visibility items.**
Conclusion:
There is a clear correlation between item visibility and sales, with low-visibility items generally underperforming in sales compared to their high-visibility counterparts. However, some low-visibility items still manage to generate significant sales, suggesting untapped potential if their visibility is improved. Enhancing the visibility of these items through strategic placement and promotions could lead to a noticeable increase in sales, helping to maximize revenue from all product offerings.
